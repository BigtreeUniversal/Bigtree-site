        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
          BigTree is a French artist, producer, writer, engineer and inventor whose path bridges music, technology, and literature.
          Introduced to music at an early age, he learned piano as a child and quickly developed a fascination for emerging technologies.
          In 1986, his father brought home an Atari 520 ST, the first computer with built-in MIDI ports, which allowed BigTree to
          experiment with audio/MIDI synchronization. These early experiments planted the seed for ‚ÄúSyncrolink‚Äù (2025), a proprietary
          protocol capable of synchronizing real-time data across advanced technological modules from aeronautics, sound engineering, and other disciplines.
        </p>

        <h3>Roots &amp; Dub Journey</h3>
        <p>
          In the mid-90s, BigTree entered the thriving reggae scene in Toulouse, eventually joining the collective Freedom Fighters as a bassist
          and beatmaker in the early 2000s. Around the same time, he founded BigTree Connection, a label and production house that became a hub for
          dozens of artists over the years. His productions are deeply rooted in dub and digital reggae, with a strong connection to the roots movement.
          After building two recording studios in Toulouse, BigTree relocated to the mountains of Ari√®ge in 2010, producing off-grid with an
          autonomous energy system. He later settled in the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales (2018) where he revived his productions and launched new collaborations.
          His album ‚ÄúRespect the Nature‚Äù led to a tour in La R√©union with the group Salazians, and since 2020 he has been working closely with the
          European sound system scene, including collaborations with Salomon Heritage.
        </p>

        <h3>Many branches</h3>
        <p>
          Alongside his music career, BigTree is a prolific writer for over 30 years, with a body of work that spans spirituality, vibrational science,
          poetry, and historical research on ancient civilizations, calendars, and lost knowledge. He considers his literary exploration as deeply
          connected to his work as an engineer and inventor, fields in which he has developed over thirty inventions and filed more than fifteen patents.
          Among these, his most significant achievement is what he calls the Tetragram, a rediscovered ‚Äúcanonical equation‚Äù from the Ancient World.
          BigTree describes this as not an invention, but the recovery of a universal code that had been lost for centuries. BigTree‚Äôs life‚Äôs work is guided
          by a single mission: to weave a bridge between music, science, and spirituality. Through his reggae productions, literary creations, and
          technological innovations, he seeks to reveal a universal language that unites people, sounds, cultures, and knowledge.
